## Implicit QR Algorithm
This repo is a rudimentary implementation of the implicit QR algorithm proposed by John G. F. Francis.
- Implement the basic idea of the "implicit" QR algorithm.
- Deal with all boundary conditions.
- Handle matrix with complex eigenvalues.
- Reasonable compuation speed(Slow compared with Matlab's implementation).
